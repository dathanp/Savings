# Savings
Savings and interest calculator

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
ANSWER: My Savings project was developed so that any user can submit how much they are wanting to save with an inital deposit, then it will ask how much they plan to deposit every month, after it will ask how many years then its interest rate. The results will be shown in a table format to showcase how much you are earning gradually and also how much your money would grow without the monthly deposits. It is a great way to plan ahead if you want to prepare for buying a house for instance or any big purchase.

What did you do particularly well?
ANSWER: I excelled well in handling any errors that could come from the user, as well as making my program as secure as I could to my knowledge.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
ANSWER: I believe I followed proper OOP techniques to give me the best security. One way I could make it even more secure is with pointers. I could change my variables with pointers so that its  accessing memory addresses allowing for enhanced security.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
ANSWER: The most challenging part for me was adding the try catch blocks. It is a best practice to use these to prevent the program from breaking. At first it was new to me so I did not know how to properly implement it, but I did eventually understand how to apply it in a secure way.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
ANSWER: The skills from this project is transferable to other projects because it helps me practice my OOP methods, my error handling with try catch blocks and unique formatting for a nice table display.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
ANSWER: I made this program maintainable because my naming conventions are clear and concise, I have added comments within my code to describe what each method or function is performing, my header file allows for any other method to be added without affecting the usability of my program. My program is readable because of my comments, it walks you through each step as my program executes. If you need a better understanding of my program I also have a pseudo code document that you could read to gain a better understanding. My program is adaptable because of the OOP methods I used. This allows for more functions or methods to be added, the main function to me altered, as well as adding more security to my header file for more variables that could be added.
